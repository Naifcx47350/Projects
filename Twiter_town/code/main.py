ok, so baiscally, this is the main file. the main idea of this project will be to somehow use twiter api 
to capture the followers that i already have, and the soon to be followers, with name and gender if possible.
and have some kind of website will it display a town full of 2d pixel people, that have the gender and name of the followers.
and maybe some other info, like how long they have been following me, and how many followers they have. 
and give some kind of interaction with the people, like clicking on them, and they will say something, or maybe even have a conversation with them.
+giving the people that followed me the longest, a bigger house, or something like that.
